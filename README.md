# Atfal Operations & Levels Program 🕋

Welcome to the central repository for **Atfal**, an Islamic kids' program operating across 20+ cities. This repository houses the operational frameworks, Hijri-based calendars, and management SOPs for our level-based educational system.

## 🚀 Program Overview
Atfal is designed as a progressive learning journey. After completing Level 1, kids advance through a structured path while new intakes refresh the cycle.

* **Level 1 (Seeds of Faith):** A 3-month foundational weekend program (currently active in 19 cities).
* **Progressive Levels:** A 5-level system where children move to the next stage every 4 months.
* **Operational Model:** A **4+2 month cycle** (4 months of active batch + 2 months of Murabbi training/launch prep).
